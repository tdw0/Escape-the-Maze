Launching the simulator:
```console
tom@desktop:~$ roslaunch uol_turtlebot_simulator simple.launch
```

Launching the RViz simulator:
```console
tom@desktop:~$ roslaunch uol_turtlebot_simulator turtlebot-rviz.launch
```

Launching the mazes to be traversed:
```console
tom@desktop:~$ roslaunch uol_turtlebot_simulator maze1.launch
tom@desktop:~$ roslaunch uol_turtlebot_simulator maze2.launch
tom@desktop:~$ roslaunch uol_turtlebot_simulator maze3.launch
```
